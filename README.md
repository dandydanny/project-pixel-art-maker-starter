## What?

A browser-based pixel art maker. Think MacPaint and Microsoft Paint, but with waaay lower pixel count.

## Why?

To practice making things with newly learned JavaScript, jQuery, and DOM manipulation skills.

## Original instructions

To get started, open `designs.js` and start building out the app's functionality.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
